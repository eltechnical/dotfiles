Welcome to my Hyprland dotfiles!, to install follow the guide:
Copy the directories or files by doing cp -r <directory/filename>, config files must be copied to ".config" on your home directory while the files that end with "rc" must be copied to your home directory (~).
Note that the files that end with "rc" must be renamed by adding a "." before the first letter of the filename.
