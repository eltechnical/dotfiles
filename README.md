--Professional version--

Welcome to my Hyprland dotfiles!  

To install, follow this guide:  
- Copy the directories or files using "cp -r <directory/filename>"
- Config files should be copied to "~/.config"  
- Files that end with "rc" should be copied to your home directory ("~")  

**Note:** Files ending with "rc" must be renamed by adding a "." before the filename (e.g., "zshrc" → ".zshrc")

🚀 Yo welcome to my Hyprland dotfiles

Aight here’s how to set this up like a real one:

- Run "cp -r <directory/filename>" to copy the files like a boss  
- Config stuff? Drop that in "~/.config" — don’t mess it up  
- Files that end in "rc" (like "zshrc", "bashrc", etc)? Throw those in your home folder ("~")

⚠️ Pro tip: Rename the "rc" files by putting a dot in front.  
Like bro, "zshrc" → ".zshrc" or it’s not gonna hit right.

That’s it. You’re officially a ricer now.  
Now go flex your setup on Reddit or something 🧠🔥
